# JobFeed
A responsive job board web application that fetches, filters, and displays job listings from an API in a grid layout.


This project is a responsive job board web application that fetches job listings from an API, displays them in a grid layout, and allows users to filter the listings based on keywords and locations. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application fetches job listings from the provided API endpoint and stores them in an array called jobs. It then dynamically creates the HTML structure for each job listing, displaying the job title, company name, location, and description. The job listings are shown in a grid layout with a 4x6 configuration, adjusting the layout according to the size of the window.

Users can filter the job listings by entering a keyword and selecting a location from a dropdown menu. The filtering function checks if the job title contains the keyword and if the job location matches the selected location. If both conditions are met, the job listing is included in the filtered results. Users can also reset the filters to display all job listings again.

In addition to the filtering functionality, the application also includes a dark mode toggle switch that allows users to switch between a light and dark theme for better readability.

To use this application, simply clone the GitHub repository and open the Job Feed with Filter Git.html file in your web browser. No additional setup is required.
